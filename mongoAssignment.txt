Q1. WRITE 5 DIFFRENCE BETWEEN MONGO DB AND SQL?
Both NoSQL and SQL support Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Data Definition Language (DDL) operations.
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MONGODB AND SQL:
1.	MongoDB stores data in a collection in a JSON document form whereas SQL stores data in table form with rows and columns.
2.	MongoDB is a schema-less structure which allows different documents in a collection to have different fields in them whereas SQL follows a fixed schema, which requires all rows to have same column.
3.	MongoDB is a NoSQL database which uses a JSON-like query language and SQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses structured query language.
4.	MongoDB is ideal for applications requiring high scalability and throughput whereas SQL is ideal for applications with structured data and complex queries.
5.	
MongoDB uses JavaScript like query language (MQL). 
* Example for insertion: 
db.users.insertOne({ name: "aimon", age: 22 });

SQL uses structured query language.
* Example for insertion:
INSERT INTO Users (name, age) VALUES (‘aimon’, 22);


Q2.WRITE ALL 6 COMMANDS AND THEIR WORK IN ROMAN URDU IN NOTE PADE FILE.

1. db.users.insertOne({ name: "aimon", age: 22 });
this command is used to insert records in the collection.

2. use databaseName
this command is used to create database.

3. show databases or show dbs
this command is used to show databases in a cluster

4. show collections
this command is used to show collections in a database

5.db.createCollection("Users")
this command is used to create collection in a database

6. db.Users.find()
this command is used to search all documents present in that collection.
